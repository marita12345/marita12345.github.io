			<p>In my current job I have heard term DevOps for several times and I have been told that our processes are partly following DevOps practices. As I have not studied anything related to DevOps before, I was interested in learning the DevOps basics in order to be able to see the whole picture about the things that we are trying to achieve in my current company. Also, as most of us in our company are rookies with DevOps, it would be also a good change to get some new ideas from the course and be able to deploy those ideas to real project use.</p>
<p>Another view to my interest in this course was that during past years DevOps have been the thing in modern software projects, so as I would like to follow the industry I assumed that I  need to know something about the DevOps. My work is in software testing area and when I check any new jobs posted from the area, most of them have word DevOps mentioned.</p>
<p>I had two main things in my expectations for learning: The first one was the DevOps process, what parts are included in &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; case. The second expectation was to get some hands on experience about the tools related to DevOps.</p>
<p>My learning expectations were quite wide, so I tried to keep in mind that this is just a one small course, so I cannot be a master after just passing this. But, I was at least hoping to get started and probably get ideas how to continue.</p>
