			<p>As wrote in my first post, my expectations for learning were DevOps process clarification and to get some hands on experience.</p>
<p>Both of my expectations were fullfilled in this course. I got a new information about the DevOps proces and the project work was good. I have used Jenkins pipelines earlier, but GitHub worflow practicalities were completely new for me, so it was interesting to build up one. I had heard that one can do a build process directly in Github, but I was not aware that it was such an easy thing to do as it was.</p>
<p>Hugo tool that was used for generating the web site was completely new for me so the logic with that was first a bit tricky for me. I got a stuck with the Hugo themes and the project tests that were testing the site content - as my chosen theme was not working as the tests were first expecting. Luckily there was a good discussion on course Slack and advices from course staff so with that help I was able to generate the site and finally put that to the workflow. I was also happy to notice that the course staff was really active to develop the tests also, so the revised tests were working with my chosen theme also.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to continue DevOps learning with some advanced course and to see more tools related to DevOps. Also, as a software tester it would be interesting to see some course that is focusing on test automation in DevOps.</p>
