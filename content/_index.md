# About the author

My occupation is in software testing area. I have been involved in test coordination, test scripting for test automation and in overall testing process planning for over 15 years. My main interests are in end user experience; how technical aspects such as performance and reliability are visible for end users who are using the software - and how to automate testing for such aspects.
