# About the site - UNDER CONSTRUCTION



My current occupation is in software testing area. I have been involved in test coordination, test scripting for test automation and in overall testing process planning. My main interests are in end user experience; how technical aspects such as performance and reliability are visible for end users who are using the software - and what are the aspects that should be considered in software testing.
